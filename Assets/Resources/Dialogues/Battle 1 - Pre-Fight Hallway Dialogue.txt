SAM “Yeah. Vault 17—military and biological research. I used to think... I could create miracles here.”
MIA “Should I... be worried?”
SAM “You don't need to worry. You can't 'worry'... can you?”
MIA “So... are we here today to create another miracle?"
SAM “If this thing—(raises the portable time-reversal device) can take me back to her...”
SAM “then maybe that’s the only miracle left.”
MIA “You mention her often.”
SAM “...I know I shouldn’t.”
MIA “Because you know I'm not her?”
SAM “Let’s not do this right now. We’ve got work to do.”
VOICEOVER ”They reach the end of the hallway and enter the first level.”
