SAM “(checking the equipment) Early-stage experimental modules.Designed for rapid tactical swaps.”
SAM “Looks like the system’s still in low-frequency standby—we can use them.”
MIA “(beginning to tinker) Ports are compatible...”
MIA “I can install thermal coils and a shock core—maybe even fuse an impact module.”
SAM “(quietly) Don’t rush to load everything.”
SAM “Pick what you can handle—what suits your rhythm.”
MIA “(nods) ...I know. Let me get a feel for it first.”
(Player selects upgrades and combos weapon modules)

MIA “(testing movements) Faster than I expected...”
MIA “The pacing’s different, but smoother.”

SAM “It was built for secrecy—which means they’ll be playing for keeps.”
MIA “(eyes steady) Then I won’t hold back either.”
SAM “(quietly) I know you won’t.”
SAM “You’ve done well already.”
SAM “(In the distance, a mechanical click. The heavy door begins to unlock and open.)”
MIA “(moving forward) Let’s go.”
MIA “You’re not alone in this, SAM.”
