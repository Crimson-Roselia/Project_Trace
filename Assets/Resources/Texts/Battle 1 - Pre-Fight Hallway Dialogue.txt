MIA “(uncertain) Should I... be worried?”
SAM “(turns to her, voice layered) You don't need to worry. You can't 'worry'... can you?”
MIA “(expressionless) So... are we here today to create another miracle?"

SAM “(pauses) then maybe that’s the only miracle left.”
MIA “You mention her often.”
SAM “...I know I shouldn’t.”
MIA “Because you know I'm not her?”
SAM “(exhales softly) Let’s not do this right now. We’ve got work to do.”
